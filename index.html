                  <h4>My name is Ryan Thurston. I was born in Elko, Nevada and that is currently where I reside. I receieved a 
                    certficate from Bridgerland Technical College in Logan, Utah in January of 2022. I enjoy many things that include 
                    technology. I started my developers journey in high school with a very basic 
                    intro to HTML class. My goal for the future is to become a well-rounded and respected
                    developer within this amazing community.

Lost control of her body functions and finally, failed to recognize anyone except my wife who used to take care of her like a mother taking care of her baby. She used to feed her, change her diapers, dress her, give her bath, brush her hair, and also help her to sleep.</div>
